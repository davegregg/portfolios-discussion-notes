# Portfolios (and other things employers may want to see)

## What might an employer want to see from an interviewing developer?

- **Ultimately: Pride in your work. Care. Attention to detail. They want to see thoughtfulness. They want to see neatness.**
- Good communication.
- An introduction to a project which explains what that project is about, and perhaps highlights interesting portions of that project.
  - README.md
    - TODOs
- Your code *itself!*
  - Readability
  - Organization
  - Algorithms
  - Comments
    - Citations
    - **WHY** you did something, not WHAT you did or HOW it works!
    - TODOs
  - Which Programming Language(s)
- Your design.
  - Not every employer will care.
  - Many will care.
